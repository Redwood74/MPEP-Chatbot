                           Agreement Concerning International Registration of Industrial Designs. The Hague
                           Agreement is an international agreement that enables an applicant to file a single
                           international design application which may have the effect of an application for
                           protection for the design(s) in countries and/or intergovernmental organizations that
                           are parties to the Hague Agreement (the “Contracting Parties”) designated in the
                           application. The United States is a Contracting Party to the Hague Agreement, which
                           took effect with respect to the United States on May 13, 2015. The Hague Agreement is
                           administered by the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property

                              the CPA is filed on or after September 16, 2012, and the prior nonprovisional
                              application contains an application data sheet meeting the conditions specified
                              in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1d8b1_212aa_46">37 CFR 1.53(f)(3)(i)</a></b> (i.e., an application data sheet
                              indicating the name, residence, and mailing address of each inventor). A
                              continuation or divisional application filed under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e318862">37 CFR

                              (CPA). A CPA has a number of advantages compared to a continuation or
                              divisional application filed under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#plt_d0e318695">37 CFR 1.53(b)</a></b>. For
                              example, the papers required to be filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark
                              Office in order to secure a filing date under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e318862">37 CFR
                                    1.53(d)</a></b> are minimal compared to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#plt_d0e318695">37 CFR
                                    1.53(b)</a></b>. In addition, the Office will not normally issue
                              a new filing receipt for a CPA. See <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319205">37 CFR 1.54(b)</a></b>. The time
                              delay between the filing date and the first Office action should be less for a
                              CPA than for an application filed under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#plt_d0e318695">37 CFR 1.53(b)</a></b>. For
                              examination priority purposes only, the USPTO will treat continuation CPAs as
                              if they were “amended” applications (as of the CPA filing date) and not as
                              “new” applications. This treatment is limited to CPAs in which the prior
                              application has an Office action issued by the examiner. If no Office action
                              has been issued in the prior application, the CPA will be treated, for
                              examination purposes, like a “new” application unless a petition to make
                              special under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e321932">37 CFR 1.102</a></b> or a request for expedited examination
                              under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324320">37 CFR
                                    1.155</a></b> is filed in the CPA. As “amended” applications
                              generally have a shorter time frame for being acted on by examiners than “new”
                              applications, the treatment of a CPA as an “amended” application will result in
                              a first Office action being mailed in the CPA much sooner than if it had been
                              filed as a continuation application under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#plt_d0e318695">37 CFR

                              applicants are strongly encouraged to file any preliminary amendment in a CPA
                              at the time the CPA is filed. See <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322734">37 CFR 1.115</a></b> and

                              The USPTO will: (A) separate the “Receipt for Facsimile Transmitted CPA” from

                              not verify whether the CPA was accompanied by other papers (e.g., a preliminary
